# Advent of Code 2023

This will be written in go.

## Why?

I chose golang because I wanted to get better at it. I've done past work and projects in it, but not enough to get a good understanding on the language. I'm hoping that this will help me improve my knowledge with Go.

## My code will be messy

Yes, it will be pretty messy at first as I just want to understand some of the patterns go has to offer, but hopefully will clean up later in the month.
